#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
>>Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
>>change impact analysis, release planning and change implementation


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
>>Design    Use the software specification document to create a detailed design 

Coding      Write, test, and integrate the code according to the design specifications 

Testing     Verify the functionality of the system
            Ensure that it meets the specified requirements
          Test the software to ensure that it meets the user requirements and is bug-free 

Deployment     Move the software from the testing environment to the operating environment 

Maintenance   Improve the product with new features
              Eliminate any recurring bugs and possible vulnerabilities
              Adapt to the software's changing needs
  
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
>>The waterfall project management method is a linear, step-by-step approach that's ideal for projects with a clear scope and predictable timeline. It involves rigorous planning upfront to ensure that the project stays on track, with progress tracked closely and issues addressed promptly. The Waterfall model usually includes five project management stages (or phases): initiation, planning, execution, monitoring/control, and closing. While this approach is effective for straightforward projects that require minimal adaptation or creativity, it may not be suitable for more complex initiatives that demand a more flexible and dynamic approach.
>>Agile methodologies are about teamwork, customer satisfaction, constant refinement, and breaking big projects into bite-sized pieces. By prioritizing collaboration and communication, agile processes enable teams to pivot and respond to evolving customer needs while maintaining a high level of flexibility. The focus on continuous improvement means that teams are always seeking ways to optimize their processes and deliver the best possible results. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
>>A software engineer's responsibilities can be grouped into six areas which mimic the software development lifecycle — capturing requirements, working on software design, development, testing, releases, and maintenance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
>>An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
>>Software engineers face challenges such as complex code, changing requirements, and time pressure. They can use a variety of strategies to overcome these challenges, including using tools, adopting new methodologies, and improving communication


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
>>Unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing are all important types of software testing that help ensure quality. 
Unit testing 

    Ensures that each part of the software functions correctly
    Focuses on the internal workings of the software
    Helps identify issues early in development 

Integration testing

    Verifies that individual modules or services work well together 
Reveals problems in the interfaces and interactions between components 
There are several types of integration testing, including top-down, bottom-up, mixed, and big-bang 

System testing 
    Validates the entire system in relation to the computer system it's part of
    Ensures that the software works properly with all of the other software and hardware systems it interfaces with 

Acceptance testing
    Ensures that the software meets user expectations and business requirements 
Is the final phase of functional testing 
Involves ensuring that the product is in compliance with all of the original business criteria 
There are several types of acceptance testing, including user acceptance, business acceptance, and regulatory acceptance 



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
>>Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) solutions to generate desired outputs. Even though generative AI attempts to mimic humans, it requires detailed instructions to create high-quality and relevant output.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
>>Unclear or Vague Prompts: Phrases like “Tell me everything about…” or “Just give me some info on…” leave the AI application guessing about your specific needs.
Example: “Tell me everything about space.” (Too broad, LLM doesn’t know where to start)
